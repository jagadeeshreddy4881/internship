IN RC CIRCUIT

The Propagation delay can be theoretically calculated as tp
tp = 0.69*r*c =0.69*1k*1p = 0.69ns


from simulation
Propagation delay
tp = 703.2E-12 = 703ps = 0.703ns

The Rise time of the output signal can be theoretically calculated as tr
tr = 202*r*c = 2.2*1k*1p = 2.2ns

from simulation
Rise time
tr = 2.196E-9 = 2.19ns = 2190ps
